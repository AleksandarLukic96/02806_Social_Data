    "## 1. Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What are the datasets**  \n",
    "We are using the following datasets:\n",
    "  - Car ownership (`KKBIL1: Privatbiler efter distrikt og drivmiddel` [Købanhavns Kommunes Statistikbank](https://kk.statistikbank.dk))\n",
    "  - Parking spaces (`Parkeringspladser` [OpenDataDK](https://www.opendata.dk/city-of-copenhagen/parkeringspladser))\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)?**  \n",
    "Parking is a big stress point for a lot of motorists, especially in larger cities. This have been and should be a concern for legislators and city planners and we wanted to see if there has been positive or negative changes over the years. The world is changing and so are the cities. Maybe parkigng opportunies are shrinking, to try and motivate people to use more greener transportation. Or perhaps there is more parking, but it has been obfuscated leaving car owners frustrated. To figure out how parking has changed and if there really are fewer parking opportunities in Copenhagen, we will look at a broad view of the city and explore if and why parking has changed over the last decades.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **What was your goal for the end user's experience?**  \n",
    "We want any site visitor to easily get a sense of the overall goal of the website upon immediatly entering the site. It should be clear that the project is exploring parking in Copenhagen and how it has evolved. The website is not a place to *find* an actual parking spot, but it should enlighten people as to *why* they cannot find parking in the city. The tabs should allow for quick access to specific topics and allows the user to quickly find their specific interest on the topic. \n",

    "\n",
    "We did individual preproccessing and data cleaning for both datasets. These can be seen in the Data_overview notebook.\n",
    "In brief, we:\n",
    "- Removed NaN rows\n",
    "- Renamed column headers to English terms (e.g. \"vejkode\" -> \"street_code\")\n",
    "- Alligned row string values that were typos or could not be matched despite concerning the same (e.g. \"Kgs. Enghave\" -> \"Vesterbro-Kongens Enghave\")\n",
    "- Removed columns we do not use for our caluclations\n",

    "For the Car Ownership, we also include the start year and end year specifically since it is not included in the data by default. \n",

    "Slideshow. We find the Slideshow type to be great for interactivity as it allows the user to quickly go to the specific parts of the analysis that they want to dive into. By speerating our webpage into tabs, we can serve the information in smaller and easier to digest portions. It also serves the additional advantage of allowing us to seperate our \"story\" into \"chapters\" which allows us to clearly show different angles of the problem without confusing the user(s).\n",

    "- **What went well?**  \n",
    "The project went well in many aspects. Our group work especially was organised and the work was well-divided and timely finished. We had weekly meetings to discuss the next steps and that helped the process tremendously. Most of our visualisations were inspired or based on the work we had done in previous notebooks which made made it easier to quickly make looks quite nice. Overall, we are happy with how the webpage and notebooks ended up looking.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is still missing / could be improved?**  \n",
    "We have been in communications with the people managing both datasets, and from these dialogues we have gathered that perhaps the data is not as complete as it seems and therefore some of our hypotheses or conclusions might not be perfect. It would be nice if we had time to compare our finding to either other datasets or some other national overview. We would also have loved to further improve the overall style of the webpage but chose to focus more so on the visualisations of the data, but it would have been cool to better align the style of the visualisations and the webpage. \n",
