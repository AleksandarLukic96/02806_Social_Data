You can also try plotting data with patterns from the 168 hours of the week. There's not one super-awesome solution here, you can try using [pure matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/pie_and_polar_charts/polar_bar.html) ... [some examples here](https://www.python-graph-gallery.com/circular-barplot/) or via [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/polar-chart/) (scroll down a bit for the polar barchart)."
